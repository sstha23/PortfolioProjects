Started this Portfolio project with Alex The Analyst whom I have been following for last couple of year now.
This is a part of Data Analyst Bootcamp!! And the most amazing thing is it is completely free and available for everyone in YouTube.
He set up a playlist called "Data Analyst Bootcamp" on his YT channel after mockingly posting something on LinkedIn as a Satire but the response was enormous. As a result, he decided to do it, thanks to him.
This Portfolio project includes all of the basics in   SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Python, and more. All accompanied by a great PROJECT.

- Gain an immersive understanding of the practices and processes used by a junior or associate data analyst in their day-to-day job
- Learn key analytical skills (data cleaning, analysis, & visualization) and tools (spreadsheets, SQL, Python programming, Tableau) 
- Understand how to clean and organize data for analysis, and complete analysis and calculations using spreadsheets, SQL and Python programming
- Learn how to visualize and present data findings in dashboards, presentations and commonly used visualization platforms
