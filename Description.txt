Started this Portfolio project with Alex The Analyst whom I have been following for last couple of year now.
This is a part of Data Analyst Bootcamp!! And the most amazing thing is it is completley free and available for everyone in YouTube.
He set up a playlist called "Data Analyst Bootcamp" on his YT channel after mockingly posting something on LinkedIn as a Satire but the response was enormous. As a result he decided to do it, thanks to him.
This Portfolio Porject includes all of the basics in SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Python, and more. All accompained by PROJECT which is great.

Tableu - Did a full project of AirBnB dataset and created a Dashboard of 2016 data set.

Below is the skill I have learned in this bootcamp:
- Gain an immersive understanding of the practices and processes used by a junior or associate data analyst in their day-to-day job
- Learn key analytical skills (data cleaning, analysis, & visualization) and tools (spreadsheets, SQL, Python programming, Tableau) 
- Understand how to clean and organise data for analysis, and complete analysis and calculations using spreadsheets, SQL and Python programming
- Learn how to visualize and present data findings in dashboards, presentations and commonly used visualization platforms
