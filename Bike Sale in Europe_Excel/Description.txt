This is a Bike Store Sales in Europe dataset downloaded from Kaggle.com
I have used this dataset and created Pivot table to analyse the sales by country and drill down by each state. Also, sorted the data by largest to smallest.
A calculatedField named CalculatedFieldForProfit is created to double check the actual profit to verify the numbers.
I have used Customer_Gender column as a filter to filter it by gender 'M' and/or 'F'.

In 2nd Pivot, I have used the date information to analyse what year the store performed it's best for each country with our sale. 
We can quickly glance and analyse the sales performance of each year for all countries.

I was able to create really useful pivot tables that anybody can look at and understand the data.
