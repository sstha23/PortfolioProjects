This is the Excel Tutorial that I did alongside Alex The Analyst in the video Tutorial series on YouTube.
I used the files that were shared in his GitHub - https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial?search=1
I learned 
    - How to use Pivot tables, 
    - mostly used formulas in Excel and how to use them.
    - how to use Xlookup and Vlookup, difference between these lookups.
    - how to better use conditional formatting
    - use of different charts
    - how to clean data in Excel
    - And, finally a full Excel project in a dataset and create different pivot tables and a Dashboard in Excel.

It was a great experience learning Excel and doing a full guided project in Excel.
